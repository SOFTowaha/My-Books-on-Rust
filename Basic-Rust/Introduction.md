Rust is a programming language developed at Mozilla Research, and backed up by a big open source community. 
Its development started in 2006 by language designer Graydon Hoare. Mozilla began sponsoring it in 2009, 
and it was first presented officially in 2010. Work on it went through a lot of iterations, culminating in
early 2015 in the first stable production version 1.0.0, developed by the Mozilla team (called the Rust Project 
Developers) and an open source community of over 750 contributors.                                                                                                Rust is based on clear and solid principles. It is a systems programming language, as capable of working at the hardware level as C and C++. It rivals idiomatic C++ in speed, but it lets you work in a much safer way by disallowing code that could cause memory problems. Moreover Rust has built-in functionality for concurrent execution on multi-core machines or in multi-processor environments.                                                            
This chapter will present you with the main reasons why Rust’'s popularity and adoption are steadily increasing. 
Then we’'ll set up a working Rust development environment.            
I will cover:
* The reasons for using Rust
* The trifecta of Rust: safe, performant and concurrent
* Using Rust
* Servo
* Installing Rust
* rustc – The Rust compiler
* Our first program
* Working with Cargo
* Developer tools
